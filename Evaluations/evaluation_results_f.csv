        } To create a matrix filled with zeros in MATLAB, you can use the `zeros` function. For example, to create a 0-by-5 matrix filled with zeros, use the following command:

        ```matlab
        B = zeros(0,5)
        ```

        This will create a 0-by-5 matrix where all elements are zero. {""answer"": ""To create a matrix filled with zeros in MATLAB, use the zeros function. For example, B = zeros(0,5) creates","Use the zeros() function:
```matlab
% Create a 3x4 matrix of zeros
A = zeros(3, 4);

% Create a square 5x5 matrix of zeros
B = zeros(5);

% Create a 1D array (row vector) with 10 zeros
C = zeros(1, 10)
```","Empty Arrays
An empty array in MATLAB® is an array that has no elements. Empty arrays are useful for
representing the concept of ""nothing"" in programming. Empty arrays have specific dimensions, and at
least one of those dimensions is 0. The simplest empty array is 0-by-0, but empty arrays can have
some nonzero dimensions, such as 0-by-5 or 3-by-0-by-5.
Creating Empty Arrays
To create a 0-by-0 array, use square brackets without specifying any values. Verify the array
dimensions by using the size function.
A = []
A =
     []
size(A)
ans = 1×2
     0     0
In most cases where you need to create an empty array, a 0-by-0 array is sufficient. However, you can
create empty arrays of different sizes by using functions like zeros or ones. For example, create a 0-
by-5 matrix and a 3-by-0-by-5 array.
B = zeros(0,5)
B =
  0×5 empty double matrix
C = ones(3,0,5)
C =
  3×0×5 empty double array
The square brackets, zeros, and ones create empty numeric arrays of the default double data type.
To create empty arrays that work with text as data, use the strings function. This function creates a
string array of any specified size with no characters. For example, create a 0-by-5 empty string array.
S = strings(0,5)
S = 
  0×5 empty string array
To create empty arrays of any data type, you can use createArray (since R2024a). For example,
create a 5-by-0 matrix of 8-bit signed integer type int8.
D = createArray(5,0,""int8"")

Matrices and Arrays
1-48; Specialized Matrix Functions
MATLAB has many functions that help create matrices with certain values or a particular structure.
For example, the zeros and ones functions create matrices of all zeros or all ones. The first and
second arguments of these functions are the number of rows and number of columns of the matrix,
respectively.
A = zeros(3,2)
A = 3×2
     0     0
     0     0
     0     0
B = ones(2,4)
B = 2×4
     1     1     1     1
     1     1     1     1
The diag function places the input elements on the diagonal of a matrix. For example, create a row
vector A containing four elements. Then, create a 4-by-4 matrix whose diagonal elements are the
elements of A.
A = [12 62 93 -8];
B = diag(A)
B = 4×4
    12     0     0     0
     0    62     0     0
     0     0    93     0
     0     0     0    -8
The createArray function (since R2024a) can return arrays of almost any MATLAB data type. The
function uses the same syntax as zeros and ones to define the size of the array, but it also offers
several options for specifying the contents of the array. For example, you can specify the fill value.
C = createArray(2,3,FillValue=duration(1,15,0))
C = 2×3 duration
   01:15:00   01:15:00   01:15:00
   01:15:00   01:15:00   01:15:00
Concatenating Matrices
You can also use square brackets to append existing matrices. This way of creating a matrix is called
concatenation. For example, concatenate; 0
     0
Matrix and Array Operations
MATLAB allows you to process all of the values in a matrix using a single arithmetic operator or
function.
a + 10
ans = 3×3
    11    13    15
    12    14    16
    17    18    20

ans = 3×3
    0.8415    0.1411   -0.9589
    0.9093   -0.7568   -0.2794
    0.6570    0.9894   -0.5440
To transpose a matrix, use a single quote ('):
a'
ans = 3×3
     1     2     7
     3     4     8
     5     6    10
You can perform standard matrix multiplication, which computes the inner products between rows
and columns, using the * operator. For example, confirm that a matrix times its inverse returns the
identity matrix:
p = a*inv(a)
p = 3×3
    1.0000    0.0000   -0.0000
         0    1.0000   -0.0000
         0    0.0000    1.0000
Notice that p is not a matrix of integer values. MATLAB stores numbers as floating-point values, and
arithmetic operations are sensitive to small differences between the actual value and its floating-point
representation. You can display more decimal digits using the format command:
format long
p = a*inv(a)
p = 3×3

        {""answer"": ""I don't know""} 

However, for reference, the correct syntax for a for loop in MATLAB typically looks like this:

```matlab

If you add a section break at line 3, inside the for loop, MATLAB adds a section break at line 9, the
end statement for the for loop. If you add a section break at line 6, inside the if statement, MATLAB
adds a section break at line 8, the end statement for the if statement, leading to three levels of
nested sections.

18-9; Choose Command Syntax or Function Syntax
MATLAB has two ways of calling functions, called function syntax and command syntax. This page
discusses the differences between these syntax formats and how to avoid common mistakes
associated with command syntax.
For introductory information on calling functions, see “Calling Functions”. For information related to
defining functions, see “Create Functions in Files” on page 20-2.
Command Syntax and Function Syntax
In MATLAB, these statements are equivalent:
load durer.mat        % Command syntax
load('durer.mat')     % Function syntax
This equivalence is sometimes referred to as command-function duality.
All functions support this standard function syntax:
[output1, ..., outputM] = functionName(input1, ..., inputN)
In function syntax, inputs can be data, variables, and even MATLAB expressions. If an input is data,
such as the numeric value 2 or the string array [""a"" ""b"" ""c""], MATLAB passes it to the function
as-is. If an input is a variable MATLAB will pass the value assigned to it. If an input is an expression,
like 2+2 or sin(2*pi), MATLAB evaluates it first, and passes the result to the function. If the
functions has outputs, you can assign them to variables as shown in the example syntax above.
Command syntax is simpler but more limited. To use it, separate inputs with spaces rather than
commas, and do not enclose them in parentheses.
functionName input1 ... inputN
With command syntax, MATLAB passes all inputs as character vectors (that is, as if they were
enclosed in single quotation marks) and does not assign outputs to user defined variables. If the
function returns an output, it is assigned to the ans variable. To pass a data type other than a
character vector, use the function syntax. To pass a value that contains a space, you have two options.
One is to use function syntax. The other is to put single quotes around the value. Otherwise, MATLAB
treats the space as splitting your value into multiple inputs.
If a value is assigned to a variable, you must use function syntax to pass the value to the function.
Command syntax always passes inputs as character vectors and cannot pass variable values.; Matrices and Arrays
MATLAB is an abbreviation for ""matrix laboratory."" While other programming languages mostly work
with numbers one at a time, MATLAB® is designed to operate primarily on whole matrices and
arrays.
All MATLAB variables are multidimensional arrays, no matter what type of data. A matrix is a two-
dimensional array often used for linear algebra.
Array Creation
To create an array with four elements in a single row, separate the elements with either a comma (,)
or a space.
a = [1 2 3 4]
a = 1×4
     1     2     3     4
This type of array is a row vector.
To create a matrix that has multiple rows, separate the rows with semicolons.
a = [1 3 5; 2 4 6; 7 8 10]
a = 3×3
     1     3     5
     2     4     6
     7     8    10
You can also define each row on its own line of code and separate the rows with a newline.
a = [1 3 5
     2 4 6
     7 8 10]
a = 3×3
     1     3     5
     2     4     6
     7     8    10
Another way to create a matrix is to use a function, such as ones, zeros, or rand. For example,
create a 5-by-1 column vector of zeros.
z = zeros(5,1)
z = 5×1
     0
     0

How do I plot a simple graph in MATLAB?,"To plot a simple graph in MATLAB, you can follow these steps:

         1. Define the data for the x-axis and y-axis. For example, you can use `linspace` to generate a range of values.
         2. Use the `plot` function to create the graph. Here's an example where we plot the sine function from 0 to \(2\pi\):

         ```matlab
         x = linspace(0, 2*pi, 100);  % Generate 100 points between 0 and 2*pi
         y = sin(x);                  % Calculate the sine of each point
         plot(x, y);                  % Plot the data
         ```

         Optionally, you can label the axes and add a title to make the plot more informative:

         ```matlab
         xlabel('x');                 % Label the x-axis as 'x'
         ylabel('sin(x)');            % Label the y-axis","Use the plot() function:
```matlab
% Create data
x = 1:10;
y = x.^2;  % y = x squared

% Plot the graph
plot(x, y);

% Add labels and title (optional)
xlabel('X values');
ylabel('Y values');
title('Simple Graph: y = x²');
grid on;  % adds grid lines
```","Graphs and Matrices
This example shows an application of sparse matrices and explains the relationship between graphs
and matrices.
A graph is a set of nodes with specified connections, or edges, between them. Graphs come in many
shapes and sizes. One example is the connectivity graph of the Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome,
which is also in the shape of a soccer ball or a carbon-60 molecule.
In MATLAB®, you can use the bucky function to generate the graph of the geodesic dome.
[B,V] = bucky;
G = graph(B);
p = plot(G);

You also can specify coordinates for the nodes to change the display of the graph.
p.XData = V(:,1);
p.YData = V(:,2);

Sparse Matrices
4-36; Create 2-D Line Plot
Create a simple line plot and label the axes. Customize the appearance of plotted lines by changing
the line color, the line style, and adding markers.
Create Line Plot
Create a two-dimensional line plot using the plot function. For example, plot the value of the sine
function from 0 to 2π.
x = linspace(0,2*pi,100);
y = sin(x);
plot(x,y)
Label the axes and add a title.
xlabel('x')
ylabel('sin(x)')
title('Plot of the Sine Function')
Plot Multiple Lines
By default, MATLAB clears the figure before each plotting command. Use the figure command to
open a new figure window. You can plot multiple lines using the hold on command. Until you use
hold off or close the window, all plots appear in the current figure window.

Graphics
4-2; Notice that the titles and labels that you defined for the first plot are no longer in the current figure
window. By default, MATLAB® clears the figure each time you call a plotting function, resetting the

To add plots to an existing figure, use hold on. Until you use hold off or close the window, all
plots appear in the current figure window.
x = linspace(0,2*pi);
y = sin(x);
plot(x,y)
hold on
y2 = cos(x);
plot(x,y2,"":"")

3-D Plots
Three-dimensional plots typically display a surface defined by a function in two variables, z = f(x, y).
For instance, calculate z = xe−x2 −y2 given row and column vectors x and y with 20 points each in the
range [-2,2].
x = linspace(-2,2,20);
y = x';
z = x .* exp(-x.^2 - y.^2);
Then, create a surface plot.
